# MyOMZ!
MyOMZ is a simple installer for oh-my-zsh (and its common-used plugins), 
with cross-user(/usr/share) installation and multiple mirrors selection, designed mainly for mainland Chinese users.

Most common Linux distros are supported. Note that macOS and BSD are not supported, and we have no plans to support them.

# How to use
Download myomz.sh in your way, then execute it as root.

For example, you can directly run this command: `sudo sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.fastgit.org/Lapis-Apple/myomz/master/myomz.sh)"`
